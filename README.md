========

This is an school project to perform <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_factorization">LU factorization</a> using the <a href = "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~flame/web/">FLAME library</a> and base code provided by the brilliant <a href = "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rvdg/">Dr. Robert van de Geijn</a>. There are various implementations using different but equivalent orders of operations, as well as blocked versus unblocked implementations. The LU.eps file compares efficiency of the implementations to the implementation provided in the FLAME library.

To run the driver, install FLAME and simply follow the commands in the makefile. Be sure to denote the proper path to your FLAME installation.
